# It's a game about catching ghosts that needs a proper name
Using the Raspberry Pi with the Sense HAT, you can look around you to find ghosts through the RGB matrix. Ghosts can be represented with a 2D list of RGB pixels.

Currently facing performance problems, I started using multiple threads, but I am going to try using NumPy instead to try keeping things simple.

I plan on allowing the player to defeat different types of ghosts and interact with menu all through the LED matrix.
